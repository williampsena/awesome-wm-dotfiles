# About

This repository includes my dot files and python scripts for Qtile.

This theme was named *Ebenezer* 🪨, which meaning "stone of helper.".

>> The quote is from I Samuel 7. After defeating the Philistines, Samuel raises his *Ebenezer*, declaring that God defeated the enemies on this spot. As a result, "hither by thy help I come."  So I hope this stone helps you in your environment and, more importantly, in your life. 🙏🏿

🚜👷🚧🏗️ This setup is under building; I'm switching my dotfiles inspired setup from Awesome Lua to Python.
